# Roma Pogoda

It is test bot for Roma, which gets weather from Yandex Forecast

For run you need export API tokens into env
```
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<token>
export YANDEX_API_KEY=<token>
```


## Plans:

* Make some like drivers for several forecast services, like OpenWeatherMap, weatheapi, etc.
